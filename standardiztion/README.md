# Standardization / Feature Scaling

This folder contains notebooks for feature scaling and standardization techniques.

## Contents
- `standarization.ipynb` - Various scaling and standardization methods
- `Social_Network_Ads (1).csv` - Sample dataset for demonstration

## Learning Topics
- StandardScaler (Z-score normalization)
- MinMaxScaler (normalization)
- Why scaling is important in ML
- Impact of scaling on different algorithms
- Comparing model performance with and without scaling

## Key Skills
- Feature scaling using scikit-learn
- Understanding data distribution before/after scaling
- Visualizing the effects of scaling
- Machine Learning model comparison
- Using Logistic Regression and Decision Trees

## Key Insights
- Scaling affects distance-based algorithms more
- Tree-based models are less sensitive to scaling
- Always fit scaler on training data only
- Apply same transformation to test data

## Algorithms Compared
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
